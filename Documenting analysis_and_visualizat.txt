Documenting analysis_and_visualization_frontend to understand it easier next time


My-Custom-Tables -> tables.tsx the view that renders the tables cards, where you can choose to press either the button visualize or the button advanced operations.

- Upon clicking on advanced operations button, in localStorage we add a variable table_id which holds the value of the table pressed, 
then we open a new window with a URL previously defined which leads to the AdvancedAnalysis component.


App -> App.tsx is just the component where all the routes are specified

Authentication -> as the name suggests

EmbeddingApp -> YourEmbeddingApp.tsx -> returns the GraphicWalker component and is called to render that component

functional -> createYourChartProps -> is the file used for converting the text csv_file into formats which are a suitable input for the GraphicWalkerComponent, returns an object with data and field variables

home -> home.tsx -> checks whether the user is logged in or out and renders buttons and html elements accordingly, also handles logout functionality upon clicking on the button

From home.tsx we can navigate to the display of table cards, but also we can add a new file if necessary.


My-Custom-Tables -> tables.tsx -> upon clicking on visualize, the handleButtonClick function calls the createYourChartProps function, after which it calls renderEmbeddingApp which returns the YourEmbeddingApp component mentioned previously.

base_styling -> contains repetitive components for navbar and footer
