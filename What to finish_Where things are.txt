Places within the project where the frontend components are rendered:

1. C:\Users\krist\Desktop\analysis_and_visualization\node_modules\@kanaries\graphic-walker\src\visualSettings\index.tsx

-- This is where the items array is located.




Things to fix:


- After clicking on submit disable button until action is completed!!!! IMPORTANT
- Implement deletion of tables (delete button)
- Consider migrating the db for tables to MongoDB
- Write queries manually 
- Consider transactions for rollbacks
